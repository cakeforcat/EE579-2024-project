# EE579-2024-project

A project which focused on the development of an autonomous RC car which is capable of playing a game of skittles. The rules of the game are simple: knock over the black cans as fast as possible while avoiding the white cans to prevent disqualification.

/RC Car 2024: Includes all project files required to configure the vehicle's peripherals and carry out the movement algorithm. A CCS workspace configured for loading code onto the MSP430G2553 is also included in the folder.
/TestingComponents: A python application which may be used to ensure correct operation of the vehicle's peripherals. 

User Guide

The repository includes both the project files and a CCS workspace configured for running the software on the MSP430G2553. Once downloaded, the workspace can be easily loaded on CCS File > Switch Workspace > Select downloaded folder>Open. Alternative IDE users must instead import each of the source and header files into a correctly configured workspace. 

A connection diagram necessary for flashing code, debugging, and UART communication is provided below.
